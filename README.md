## Python Crawlee with BeautifulSoup template

A template for [web scraping](https://apify.com/web-scraping) data from websites starting from provided URLs using Python. The starting URLs are passed through the Actor's input schema, defined by the [input schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema). The template uses [Crawlee for Python](https://crawlee.dev/python) for efficient web crawling,  handling each request through a user-defined handler that uses [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) to extract data from the page. Enqueued URLs are managed in the [request queue](https://crawlee.dev/python/api/class/RequestQueue), and the extracted data is saved in a [dataset](https://crawlee.dev/python/api/class/Dataset) for easy access.

## Included features

- **[Input schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema)** - define and validate a schema for your Actor's input.
- **[Request queue](https://crawlee.dev/python/api/class/RequestQueue)** - manage the URLs you want to scrape in a queue.
- **[Dataset](https://crawlee.dev/python/api/class/Dataset)** - store and access structured data extracted from web pages.
- **[Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)** - a library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.

## Getting started

For complete information [see this article](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development#build-actor-locally). To run the actor use the following command:

```bash
apify run
```

## Deploy to Apify

### Connect Git repository to Apify

If you've created a Git repository for the project, you can easily connect to Apify:

1. Go to [Actor creation page](https://console.apify.com/actors/new)
2. Click on **Link Git Repository** button

### Push project on your local machine to Apify

You can also deploy the project on your local machine to Apify without the need for the Git repository.

1. Log in to Apify. You will need to provide your [Apify API Token](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations) to complete this action.

    ```bash
    apify login
    ```

2. Deploy your Actor. This command will deploy and build the Actor on the Apify Platform. You can find your newly created Actor under [Actors -> My Actors](https://console.apify.com/actors?tab=my).

    ```bash
    apify push
    ```
